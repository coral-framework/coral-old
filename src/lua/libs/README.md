Lua Libraries
=============

This directory contains copies of the following Lua libraries:

- lua: [Lua 5.2](http://www.lua.org/) (stripped of lua.c, luac.c and print.c)
- lfs: [LuaFileSystem](http://www.keplerproject.org/luafilesystem/)
- socket: [LuaSocket](http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/)

All these libraries are licensed under the MIT license (same as Coral).
They are compiled into a static library and linked with the Lua Module.
