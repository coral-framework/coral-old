This directory contains public (exported) APIs whose usage is somehow limited (or **reserved**) to _automatically-generated_ code or _lower-level_ tools.

- Lexical utility functions;
- Platform abstraction functions;
- Auxiliary API for (un-)registering module libraries;
- Base classes for most generated classes;
- The UUID class implementation (used by the co.Uuid native class).
