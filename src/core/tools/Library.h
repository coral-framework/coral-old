/*!
	Platform-independent handling of dynamic-link libraries (DLLs).
 
	The concept of a DLL for this class is platform independent; i.e. a DLL could be
	a shared object (\c .so) on UNIX, a dynamic library (\c .dylib) on Mac OS, or a
	dynamic-link library (\c .dll) on Windows.
 
	Each Library instance operates on a single library file. Basic operations are:
	  - load(): loads the library. Calling load() is optional, since resolve() calls it internally.
	  - resolve(): resolves the address of an exported library symbol.
	  - unload(): attempts to unload the library.
	Load/unload errors are raised as exceptions.
 
	\par Load Hints
	In UNIX-based systems, it is possible to control \e when and \e how library symbols are bound
	by specifying <em>load hints</em> (see setLoadHints()). By default, all symbols are bound when
	the library is loaded, and exported symbols are "hidden" from other modules (i.e. only accessible
	through resolve()). All load hints are currently ignored on Windows.
