/*
	Manages the system's services database, providing contextualized service lookups.

	A module may publish its services with the IServiceManager in order to make
	them available for consumption by other modules.

	Services are always identified by interface type. An interface instance may be published as
	either the global provider of a certain service (e.g. using addService()), or as a specialized
	service provider for clients of a certain interface type (e.g. using addServiceForType()).
	Whenever a service is published twice, the latest provided instance replaces the pre-existing instance.

	The IServiceManager supports three kinds of lookups:
		- Lookup by <tt>service type</tt>: getService().
		- Lookup by <tt>service type + client <b>type</b></tt>: getServiceForType().
		- Lookup by <tt>service type + client <b>instance</b></tt>: getServiceForInstance().
